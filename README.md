# Japanese house tour

I recently went to Japan to visit my grandparents (and visit places), but I knew that it would be well over 1 year until I would see them again. So knowing that, I took a 360 video and multiple photographs of their house and when I got back to the United Kingdom, I wrote a project that compiled all of those photographs together to make a virtual tour!

# Information

As of June, 2025 this project is yet to work because I need to upload and link all of the photographs and 360 videos to Google Drive, but for private showcasing I have saved them to my hard-drive. Unfortunately, these photographs and 360 videos are not yet publically avaliable, and the Google Drive links will be encoded for security.
